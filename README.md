# microservice_blog

This is a simple "bulletin-board"-style blog site that allows users to create posts and comment on others.

It is built using a microservices structure, following the first project in Stephen Grider's Microservices course on Udemy. The app is built with React and Node.js. It is split into six services, and set up to be contained and orchestrated through Docker and Kubernetes.

At this time there is no back end, nor live deployment. I plan to continue making my own changes to this ofundation, and may deploy it at a future time.
